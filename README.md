## 📌 Project Overview

This project includes:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing values, converting data types, and encoding categorical features.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualizing churn patterns, tenure trends, contract types, and payment method behavior.

- **Customer Segmentation**  
  Grouping customers based on tenure and monthly spending.

- **Churn Prediction Model**  
  Logistic Regression model predicting customer churn with ~80% accuracy.

- **Customer Retention Insights**  
  Key churn drivers and actionable business strategies.

- **Power BI Dashboard**  
  Final visual presentation of insights.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Install the required Python libraries:

### 2. Run the Python script:


This generates:
- cleaned dataset  
- churn model accuracy  
- churn classification report  
- segmentation fields  
- optional EDA plots

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key visual insights generated in Python:

- Churn rate distribution  
- Tenure distribution  
- Contract type vs churn  
- Monthly charges trends  

If screenshots are included, they can be found in the `/images` folder.

## 🔍 Customer Segmentation

Two segmentation strategies were applied:

- **Tenure-based segments:**  
  - New (0–12 months)  
  - Mid (12–36 months)  
  - Loyal (36+ months)

- **Spend-based segments:**  
  - Low  
  - Medium  
  - High

These segments were visualized in Power BI to analyze churn rates across groups.

## 🤖 Churn Prediction Model

A Logistic Regression model was trained on the encoded dataset.

**Model Metrics:**
- Accuracy: ~80%
- Performance: Balanced precision, recall, and F1-score across churn and non-churn classes.

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

- Overall churn rate  
- Tenure distribution  
- Churn by contract type  
- Churn by payment method  
- Segmentation-based churn comparisons
